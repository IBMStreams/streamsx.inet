# README --  FrameworkTests

This directory provides an automatic test for a number of operators of the inet toolkit.

## Test Execution

To start the full test execute:  
`./runTest.sh`

To start a quick test, execute:  
`./runTest.sh --category quick`

This script installs the test framework in directory `scripts` and starts the test execution. The script delivers the following result codes:  
0     : all tests Success  
20    : at least one test fails  
25    : at least one test error  
26    : Error during suite execution  
130   : SIGINT received  
other : another fatal error has occurred  

More options are available and explained with command:  
`./runTest.sh --help`

## Test Sequence

The `runTest.sh` installs the test framework into directory `scripts` and starts the test framework. The test framework 
checks if there is a running Streams instance and starts the ftp test server and the the http test server automatically. 

If the Streams instance is not running, a domain and an instance is created from the scratch and started. You can force the 
creation of instance and domain with command line option `--clean`

In the standard environment the ftp-test server is started automatically from the test script. If the 
property `TTPR_ftpServerHost` is set to a non empty value, the automatic start is skipped and the provided server is used. 
In this case the properties `TTPR_ftpServerUser` and `TTPR_ftpServerPasswd` must provide the username and password for the ftp-tests. 
You can skip the ftp test cases if the property `TTPR_ftpServerHost` is set to an empty value.

In the standard environment the http-test server is started automatically from the test script. If the 
property `TTPR_httpServerHost` is set, the automatic start is skipped and the provided server is used. In this case you must also 
provide `TTPR_httpServerAddr` and `TTPR_httpsServerAddr`. This values must have the form <hostname>:<port>

The inet toolkit is expected in directory `../../com.ibm.streamsx.inet/` and must be built with the current Streams version. 
The inet toolkit samples are expected in `TTRO_streamsxInetSamplesPath`. 

Use command line option `-D <name>=<value>` to set external variables or provide a new properties file with command line option 
`--properties <filename>`. The standard properties file is `tests/TestProperties.sh`.

## Requirements

The test framework requires an valid Streams installation and environment.

The ftp test server requires the packages **vsftpd** and **ftp**. Additionally the current user must be able to execute 
`service vsftpd start` without password interaction (sudoers configuration). Alternatively you can start the ftp server by 
hand and provide property `TTPR_ftpServerHost`.
If the standard setup of the ftp server is used, an user `ftpuser` with password `streams` is required. This standart setup can be overwritten
with properties `TTPR_ftpServerUser` and `TTPR_ftpServerPasswd` in TestProperties.sh file.

*Note:* The FtpTest requires an running ssh daemon at the ftp server host.

The http test server requires the java 1.8 runtime from the streams installation: 
The http test server requires that ports 8097 and 1443 are available at the local host.
