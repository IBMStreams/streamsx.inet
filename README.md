##README --  IBMStreams/streamsx.inet

The IBMStreams/streamsx.inet toolkit project is an open source IBM InfoSphere Streams toolkit project supporting common internet protocols, such as HTTP, WebSockets, etc.

Note that development is proceeding on two branches: 
* The v2.0.0 branch is currently at version 2.0.1, and it contains what's shipped with the Streams product.   
* The master branch is at version 2.6, and it contains several more operators, including the FTP operators, `HTTPTupleInjection` and `HTTPTupleView`.  It should be considered pre-release.
